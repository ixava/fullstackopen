user clicks save -> browser executes onsubmit event handler
	form.onsubmit prevents default post behaviour, adds new note to the notes array, resets input field, calls redrawNotes function
		redrawNotes creates a ul with all notes from notes array as li children, removes old ul element from #notes div, appends new ul to #notes div
	form.onsubmit continues; executes sendToServer function
		sendToServer -> Browser sends HTTP POST request with new note in json format to server
